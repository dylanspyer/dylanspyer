  # Hello 👋 I'm Dylan Spyer 🙂👨‍💻

💻 Hi, I'm Dylan. I'm a software engineer based out of Austin, TX 🤠. Passionate about learning and problem-solving through code, I thrive on tackling complex challenges with creative solutions.

### 🧠 Cerebellum Realtime

🔭 Most recently, I co-created [Cerebellum](https://cerebellum-realtime.github.io/). Cerebellum is an open-source cloud-based infrastructure and library that provides an easy way to develop realtime web applications built to scale. It takes care of common realtime requirements such as connection state recovery, data persistence, user presence, authentication, and more. ✨

### 🌴 Outside of Work

I'm usually coaching or practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, playing chess, or trying something new. Most recently, I started learning to play the piano 🎹.
